### fiber_photometry_video_sync_v4_3.m

**What’s new in this version:**
- **Baseline Correction**  
  Implements an adjustable baseline correction routine to compensate for drift over the course of a fiber‑photometry recording.
- **Low‑Pass Filter Subtraction**  
  Adds a subtractive low‑pass filter step to remove slow fluctuations and isolate fast signal components.
- **User Control over Baseline Shift**  
  Exposes parameters so that users can visually inspect and correct any residual baseline shifts before final analysis
These additions make it easier to correct for slow drifts and improve the accuracy of ΔF/F calculations during simultaneous video and photometry synchronization.

### fiber_photometry_video_sync_v4_4.m
- **Modern UI: Redesigned with uigridlayout; video (top 2/3) + signal (bottom 1/3); cleaner control bar.
- **Zoom Mode: Centered on current time with auto Y-axis; adjustable window width.
- **Signal Processing: Low-pass smoothing (adjustable cutoff), cubic baseline correction, add ΔF/F% normalization, optional high-frequency (raw–LP).
- **Behavior Tools: Tag 1 & 2, export to Excel (two sheets) + TIFF snapshot.
- **Playback: Play/pause, ±5s navigation, slider sync, safe timer cleanup.
